by Team Falcon, Developer's Society, BITS Goa

## INTRODUCTION
â€‹Our project is an informative website for a futuristic car. We have taken inspiration from some of the already existing vehicles and concepts available across. We have also used the animations and graphics that were available to us on the web.

### Some of the key features
1. We have included video backgrounds without affecting the minimalist design approach.
2. Hover effects to almost every button
3. A non-static logo
4. A fixed side navigation bar to effectively scroll through the first page
5. A scroll snap feature which enhances user experience while scrolling the page
6. Responsive to the screen size

## TECHNICALITIES

Despite not having a single member with the knowledge of JS and backend development, we tried our best to make an informative website using just HTML and CSS.
In the process of making this website we have tried to explore as many features as possible of HTML and CSS. We have also tried to make the website responsive to the best of our knowledge.
The site has some amazing navigation experience through different web pages linked to each other, along with appropriate use of background color and gradient which goes well with the text size, color and font, making it user friendly. 


## OUR EXPERIENCE

Hello, we are a group of budding  developers who stepped into the field of web dev in the name of exploring different things in college.But the journey has been pretty nice actually.
We all were too new to the development stuff and all could barely learn HTML and CSS only in this online sem cum crash course.We tried different individual projects earlier and tried to merge everything we learnt in this group project be it animation, video in background,responsive, flex, grid etc. which may sound pretty basic to you. But trust me for us the case wasn't the same for us. One more thing to mention I learnt that binge watching videos from a roadmap did not give us as much knowledge as this project provided us.
We spent a lot of time searching for a basic attribute to make our site responsive and knowingly or unknowingly learnt few other attributes altogether.We learnt about managing different HTML and CSS files together. Div, Section,class, id which sounded pretty similar at the beginning. Now surely things have changed.Most importantly this gave us first hand experience on working in a group together and gave us the slight feel about life of a developer.
